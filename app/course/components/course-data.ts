Three types: 1) Problem diagnosis - 'DAU dropped 30%', test systematic analysis, 2) Tradeoff evaluation - 'improve engagement but reduce revenue', test decision-making, 3) Behavioral - 'how do you resolve conflicts?', test collaboration. Scoring: ability to diagnose systematically, critical thinking, clear communication, quantitative skills. Best prep: shadow engineers during outages, do cross-team projects."
